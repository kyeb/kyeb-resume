# Kye's resume

This is just a git repo to keep track of changes to my resume as the years go
by. For now, this is just a single one-page resume, but may be updated to a full
CV later.

## Setup

Currently, I'm using the beta [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html) to build this. Just install tectonic and run:

```
tectonic -X watch
```

in the root directory of this repository, and it automatically compiles to `build/resume/kyeb_resume.pdf` and rebuilds on any changes!
